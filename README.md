Examples of various algorithms programmed in various languages for reference

# Contribution
Please try to keep the file structure somewhat consistent.  Each type of Algorithm gets it's own folder.  Within that create a folder with whatever language you are using to implement the algorithm.  Test files go within a separate folder so that they are more easily grouped for all languages.

Main:
* algorithm
  - language
    - code
  - Test
    - testfiles.txt

Please comment each function reasonably well, and structure code to be readable and functional.  I will not merge PRs that do not follow these guidelines.
